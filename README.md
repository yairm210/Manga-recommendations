# Reading recommendations

I tend to give out these recommendations a lot, so at least let's make it organized


### Martial arts action series

- **Peerless Dad** (ongoing) - Middle aged slightly-above-average mercenary becomes a dad  in a wuxia setting and the most non-standard martial arts protaganist ever
- **Gosu** (ended) - Art-focused Wuxia with an intense foxus on large, cinematic setpieces.
- **Red Storm** - wuxia martial arts in a tribal desert setting
- **Veritas** (ended) - Modern day Korean martials-arts-school, but serious, with discrimination issues and people actually dying. Not so much "dark" as "probably more realistic".
- **Until death do us part** (ended) - Modern day blind-ish swordsman fights people with modern weapons.
- **Teppu (ended) - Equal parts 'technically accurate female MMA' and 'self-discovery through fighting'
- **The Breaker (ended) - Modern-day wuxia.
- **Holyland (ended) - Realistic. Street fighting as a journey of attaining self-worth.
- **Angel Densetsu** (ended) - action-comedy, timid guy who looks like a demon delinquent.

### Other action

- **Kekkaishi** (ended) - Best Shounen-ish manga in existance, as far as I'm concerned. Excellent characterization, motivations, and plot, and the most believable protaganist in a shounen ever.
- **Assassianation classroom** (ended) - action/gag manga about a superhuman octopus-like teacher and his classroom of students that he's encouraging to try and kill him. As zany as it sounds.
- **Bokko** (ended) - Defending a town from a siege in ancient china. It's much ore than that, but hard to summarize.
- **Psyren** (ended) - classic shounen, done well. Time travel, psychic powers, etc.
- **Wakusei no samidare** (ended) - I remember it was good, but not much about it

### Other

- **Bakuman** (ended) - A "non-battle battle manga" about an author-artist duo making manga. Great characterization!
- **Dr. Stone** (ended) - SCIENCE based manga, the first of its kind! Modern-day superscientist recreates modern tech!
- **Otoyomegatari** (ongoing) - Relationship-focused story about bridal customs in 18th century Kazahstan with the most amazing art
- **Mushishi** (ended) - A manga that evades description. Supernatural nature manga about an expert in these natural life forms that visits villages stricken by them.
- **Bartender** (ended) - an emotions-focused manga more about people coming to terms with something in their life than about mixing drinks
- **Planetes** (ended) - Hard sci-fi about a cleanup crew for space junk
- **Bonnouji** (ended) - Cutest romance manga about an office worker and a work-at-home with a house full of random stuff his brother sends him while travelling.
- **Pluto** (ended) - I literally cried from this one. Urasawa pulls out all the feels for this robot murder mystery.
- **Train man / densha otoko** (ended) - An old romance that I can't seem to find anymore :/

# Non Manga media

- [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com) - Names grant powers, narrative structure is built into the world, and yet the world semems real in a way that others aren't due to the fantastic detail and reprecussions of everything.
- [The Regressed Demon Lord Is Kind](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-regressed-demon-lord-is-kind) - Time reversal, background plot related to time reversal, and a protaganist that is hilarious and has a shitty personality. This is the the best thing on the website, because unlike Seoul Station Necromancer, Warlock of the Magus World, Everyone is a Regressor but Me, Second Life Ranker, etc, it has GOOD CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS and ACTUAL PLOT. (Second Coming Of Gluttony deserves a shoutout for being the best of the "I'm gonna get stronger" series)
- [Necropolis Immortal](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal) is a genre-reversing cultivation story. It's hardly about fighting, or even cultivating, it's about plots and revealing the truth of the world and improving the world. VERY odd, especially when compared to its contemporaries such as A Will Eternal, I Shall Seal The Heavens, NSHBA etc, but I loved it.
- [Wizard's Tower](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower) - Fantasy setting where the world is about to end from a plague of hydras, we follow an old grumpy wizard who likes annoying people and hates carrots as gradually a village of refugees is built around his tower.
- [Sylver Seeker](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker) - Arch-necromancer wakes up and discovers the world now has a 'system' with skills and classes and levels, his goal is to find his old family of immortals one at a time. This can get graphical, for example he literally rebuilds his own body, so be warned.
- [Jackal among snakes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48969/jackal-among-snakes) - Game wiki writer becomes a game character, the world will be destroyed, and he must rely on his game knowledge and his silver tongue. Only 100 chapters in but already one of the best stories of its kind.
