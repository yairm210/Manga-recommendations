# Manga-recommendations

I tend to give out these recommendations a lot, so at least let's make it organized


Martial arts action series:
- Peerless Dad (ongoing) - Middle aged slightly-above-average mercenary becomes a dad  in a wuxia setting and the most non-standard martial arts protaganist ever
- Gosu - Art-focused Wuxia with an intense foxus on large, cinematic setpieces.
- Red Storm - wuxia martial arts in a tribal desert setting
- Veritas (ended?) - Modern day Korean martials-arts-school, but serious, with discrimination issues and people actually dying. Not so much "dark" as "probably more realistic".
- Until death do us part (ended) - Modern day blind-ish swordsman fights people with modern weapons.
- Teppu (ended) - Equal parts 'technically accurate female MMA' and 'self-discovery through fighting'
- The Breaker - Modern-day wuxia.
- Holyland - Realistic. Street fighting as a journey of attaining self-worth.
- Angel Densetsu - Timid guy who looks like a demon delinquent. 

Other action:

- Kekkaishi (ended) - Best Shounen-ish manga in existance, as far as I'm concerned. Excellent characterization, motivations, and plot, and the most believable protaganist in a shounen ever.
- Assassianation classroom - action/gag manga about a superhuman octopus-like teacher and his classroom of students that he's encouraging to try and kill him. As zany as it sounds.
- Bokko (ended) - Defending a town from a siege in ancient china. It's much ore than that, but hard to summarize.
- Psyren (ended) - classic shounen, done well. Time travel, psychic powers, etc.
- Wakusei no samidare - I remember it was good, but not much about it

Other
- Otoyomegatari (ongoing) - Relationship-focused story about bridal customs in 18th century Kazahstan with the most amazing art
- Mushishi (ended) - A manga that evades description. Supernatural nature manga about an expert in these natural life forms that visits villages stricken by them.
- Bartender (ended) - an emotions-focused manga more about people coming to terms with something in their life than about mixing drinks
- Bakuman (ended) - A "non-battle battle manga" about an author-artist duo making manga. Great characterization!
- Planetes (ended) - Hard sci-fi about a cleanup crew for space junk
- Bonnouji (ended) - Cutest romance manga about an office worker and a work-at-home with a house full of random stuff his brother sends him while travelling.
- Pluto (ended) - I literally cried from this one. Urasawa pulls out all the feels for this robot murder mystery.
- Train man (densha otoko) - romance that I can't seem to find anymore :/
