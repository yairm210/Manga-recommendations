I tend to give out these recommendations a lot, so at least let's make it organized


kurogane (ended)
planetes (ended)

Martial arts action series
- Peerless Dad (ongoing) - Middle aged slightly-above-average mercenary becomes a dad  in a wuxia setting and the most non-standard martial arts protaganist ever
- Gosu - Art-focused Wuxia with an intense foxus on large, cinematic setpieces.
- Veritas (ended?) - Modern day Korean martials-arts-school, but serious, with discrimination issues and people actually dying. Not so much "dark" as "probably more realistic".
- Until death do us part (ended) - Modern day blind-ish swordsman fights people with modern weapons.
- Teppu - Equal parts 'technically accurate female MMA' and 'self-discovery through fighting'

Other
- Kekkaishi (ended) - Best Shounen-ish manga in existance, as far as I'm concerned. Excellent characterization, motivations, and plot, and the most believable protaganist in a shounen ever.
- Mushishi - 
- Bartender - an emotions-focused manga more about people coming to terms with something in their life than about mixing drinks
- Bokko (ended) - 
- Bakuman (ended) - A "non-battle battle manga" about an author-artist duo making manga. Great characterization!
- Otoyomegatari - Relationship-focused story about bridal customs in 18th century Kazahstan with the most amazing art
